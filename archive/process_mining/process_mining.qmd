# Summary
[Proces Mining](http://www.processmining.org/story/production.html) is an Data Science sub-discipline dedicated to analyzing event logs. Key metrics are usually related to things like: "how efficient is this workstation?", or conversely, "Which process is the greatest bottle-neck?".

Self-described as "pratical data science", Process Mining is a concrete means of creating business value. Pioneered by Dutch computer scientist [Wil van der Aalst](http://www.padsweb.rwth-aachen.de/wvdaalst/), the field is defined by an extremely tight focus on industry problems rather than arcane optimization formulae.

[What Process Mining Is, and Why Companies Should Do It](https://hbr.org/2019/04/what-process-mining-is-and-why-companies-should-do-it).

For this article, we're going to use [pm4py](https://pm4py.fit.fraunhofer.de) to analyze a randomly generated event-log and to create a performance management report for decision-makers.

# Python

```{python}
import numpy as np
from mpl_toolkits import mplot3d
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

```{python}
 #| label: normal distribution of random numbers
 #| fig-cap A line historgram 

rng = np.random.default_rng();
vals = rng.standard_normal(100);

df = pd.DataFrame(vals, columns = ["one"]);
df.plot.hist(bins=25, alpha=0.5);
```

```{python}
fig = plt.figure()
ax = plt.axes(projection='3d')
```

```{python}
ax = plt.axes(projection='3d')

# Data for a three-dimensional line
zline = np.linspace(0, 15, 1000)
xline = np.sin(zline)
yline = np.cos(zline)
ax.plot3D(xline, yline, zline, 'gray')

# Data for three-dimensional scattered points
zdata = 15 * np.random.random(100)
xdata = np.sin(zdata) + 0.1 * np.random.randn(100)
ydata = np.cos(zdata) + 0.1 * np.random.randn(100)
ax.scatter3D(xdata, ydata, zdata, c=zdata, cmap='Greens');
