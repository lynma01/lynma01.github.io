# Summary:
___
Graph databases represent data in a "node - edge - node" format. This novel data format is normally used for social-network data. However, graph databases can be used for any kind of "network" analysis: work-flows, machine-processes, systems-models.

In this article, I will demonstrate creating these three different examples and why composing these data-models in graph format yields important analytical benefits.


# Graph databases
___
For this article, we're going to be using [CogDB](https://cogDB.io) as our graph database. CogDB is a python implementation of a graph database. Naturally, it's only intended for light-weight uses cases - so it's perfect for us as we articulate our ideas about systems and networks.

```{python}
from cog.torque import Graph
g = Graph("people")
g.put("alice" , "follows", "bob")
g.put("bob", "follows", "alice")

g.v().tag("from").out("follows").tag("to").view("follows").render()
```
Machine system:
Every node is a production center. Every edge is a transportation-coordinate.
    - What's produced? What's consumed? and in what quantities?

Community system:
Every node is a restaurant/school. Every edge is a social tie.

Dataframe which serves as an event-log of node-production/consumption of resources.
