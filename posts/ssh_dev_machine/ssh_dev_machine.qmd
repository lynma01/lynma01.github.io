# Making your own ssh public key
https://linuxhandbook.com/ssh-basics/

```{bash}
ssh-keygen
```

Creates both your public & private KEY, however, when we execute `ssh lynma01@[remote_host]`, we'll see an error about a man-in-the-middle attack. This is because we haven't added the remote-hosts' public key into the file `~/.ssh/known_hosts`.


# Adding the remote hosts public key
https://www.baeldung.com/linux/public-key-known_hosts

Adding the remote-hosts' is as simple as:
```{bash}
ssh-keyscan >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
```

Once that command has completed, you'll be able to login to the remote machine using `ssh $USER_NAME@$REMOTE_DOMAIN`. You will be prompted to input the user's password.
