# Business-as-Code

## Concept-in-Brief
Which is the stronger organization? The one which shares the same PowerPoint 1,000 times? Or the one which shares its code only once?

### What's the Problem?
Most businesses, or organizations have an enormous supply of PowerPoints, Word Documents, and/or Training materials. Those materials are ephemeral ideas because they were created by managers trying to envision for its employees how the world _should be_ based on their previous experience about what the customers problems are. 

The problem, for any member of the organization reading or listenting to all of these ideas, is deciding what to trust; which of these many PowerPoints, documents, or managers' experience  *actually* reflects the reality of what they have to deal with? 

When rubber hits the road, no one wants to have wasted their time trying to learn a set of processes or procedures which in no way reflect the problems they'll face. If anything, its because of many peoples' continuous experience of having their trust broken by such materials which don't reflect reality that I believe there's so much cynacism in the workplace today.

So whenever a question arises about some slice of reality, our organization can reference one of our many dashboards and feel confident it knows the size and scope of the phenomena it's confronting. 

However, (besides Finance because they have to sign statements to auditors) most departments within any organization don't have anywhere near the same standards. Most organizational departments   

Naturally, these material are theoretical. Managers are, by nature of any organizational hierarchy, the most removed from actually meeting with and interacting with customers. Likewise, Executives, as managers of managers, are even *further* removed than their mid-level or low-level managers.

I've always been of the opinion that "language" has never been a monolith, especially when it comes to business, code, and communicating with other people. On a scale  technical-writing sits above prose, code sits above technical-writing, until we finally hit pure-mathematics. This is not to say that one's better than the other, rather, that they rest on top of one another like stages on a pyramid. Most of us can't skip steps when it comes to
