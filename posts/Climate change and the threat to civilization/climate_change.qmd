## How do we measure civilization-collapse?
1. How are current civilizations performing?
2. If we were to create a model of civilization-collapse, what should be included?

## There's local collapse, regional collapse, and civilizational collapse.

In turn, the mechanisms by which these collapses occur are: 1) direct impacts, 2) socio-climate feedbacks, and 3) exogenous shock vulnerability.
