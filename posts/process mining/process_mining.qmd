# Summary
___
Process Mining is an analytical field dedicated to extracting performance measurements from event logs. Key metrics are usually related to things like: "how quickly are we able to cycle through a given process?", or conversely, "where are the bottle-necks within our business-processes?".

For this article, we're going to use [pm4py](https://pm4py.fit.fraunhofer.de) to analyze a randomly generated event-log and to generate a performance management report.
