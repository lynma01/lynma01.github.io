# Introduction {#sec-introduction}
I'd started today thinking I'd be writing a very different post. As I was sketching-out my idea, I quickly realized I wasn't familiar enough with [Quarto](https://quarto.org) to incorporate its best parts. Instead, I've thrown together this post about my favorite concepts in writing, and how to implement them.

## Why Use Quarto?
It's the closest I've currently got to a "***Literate Programming***"[^literate_programming] platform


# Putting the "Literate" in Literate Programming

## Heading numbers

## Cross-References & Footnotes[^footnotes]
This is a key portion of working across large bodies of text. Especially as different posts begin to reference other sections within the current post. Most of all, using the footnotes[^footnotes] 


## Embeds (AKA: "Includes")[^includes]


# Running Computations  


## Using Quarto's Widget System
I really like the look of the Perspective[^perspective] widget library within my notebooks. Perspective already has some examples for how to include their widgets within a notebook[^perspective_jupyter]. It's also got some really cool options for [plotting simulations in a browser](https://www.prospective.co/blog/market-simulation).
