# Introduction {#sec-introduction}
I'd started today thinking I'd be writing a very different post. As I was sketching-out my idea, I quickly realized I wasn't familiar enough with [Quarto](https://quarto.org) to incorporate the functions I value in other blogs/newsletters I really enjoy. So instead, I've thrown together this post about my favorite concepts in writing, and how to implement them.

# My favorite reading-tools on the internet:
## Links

## Heading numbers

## 

# Cross References {#sec-crossref}
This is a key portion of working across large bodies of text. Especially as different posts begin to reference other sections within the current post. Most of all, using the footnotes[^footnotes] 


# Using Quarto's Widget System
I really like the look of the Perspective[^perspective] widget library within my notebooks.
