# Introduction {#sec-introduction}
I'd started today thinking I'd be writing a very different post. As I was sketching-out my idea, I quickly realized I wasn't familiar enough with [Quarto](https://quarto.org) to incorporate its best parts. Instead, I've made this post about my favorite parts of online writing, and how to implement them within Quarto.

## Why Use Quarto?
It's the best tool I can think of which:
    
1. Can implement the "***Literate Programming***"[^literate_programming] paradigm, a method of writing and coding that I've always been fascinated with.
    
2. Allows me to easily publish this website/blog thing with all my favorite reading UI/UX features.  
    
3. It looks good, which, let's be honest, matters a great deal.  


# Putting the "Literate" in Literate Programming

## Heading numbers

## Cross-References & Footnotes
This is a key portion of working across large bodies of text. Especially as different posts begin to reference other sections within the current post[^cross_references]. Most of all, footnotes are an often underrated tool for writers: while Infinite Jest is a great example of how footnotes can be fun, [Matt Levine, author of Bloomberg's Money Stuff](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/authors/ARbTQlRLRjE/matthew-s-levine) does a great job of showing how footnotes can be both helpful ***and*** fun.  


## Embeds (AKA: "[Includes](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/includes.html)")
Depending on how it's implemented, re-using previous content can either be a useful method for reinforcing and important idea, or a really fucking annoying method of maximizing an SEO ranking. [^includes]


# Running Computations  


## Using Quarto's Widget System
I really like the look of the Perspective[^perspective] widget library within my notebooks. Perspective already has some examples for how to include their widgets within a notebook[^perspective_jupyter]. It's also got some really cool options for [plotting simulations in a browser](https://www.prospective.co/blog/market-simulation).
