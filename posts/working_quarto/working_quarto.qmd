# Introduction {#sec-introduction}
I'd started today thinking I'd be writing a very different post.  that I'd had this morning, but I quickly realized that I wasn't familiar enough with this blogging platform ([Quarto](https://quarto.org)) to accomplish the kind of published "look" that I wanted. Given there's not time like the present, I figured I'd write a quick post about the most important feature 


# Cross References {#sec-crossref}
This is a key portion of working across large bodies of text. Especially as different posts begin to reference other sections within the current post. Most of all, using the footnotes[^footnotes] 


# Using Quarto's Widget System
I really like the look of the Perspective[^perspective] widget library within my notebooks.
