# README
This is a planning document for the Space Bureacrat series. It's going to outline all the different episodes/case-studies within the series. Might also be good to do some character/narrative arcs in here. Not really sure yet.

# Synopsis:
The year is 2140 and humanity is now doing its thing amongst the stars (fucking shit up). You're a young technocrat on the rise within the Department of Social Wellbeing & Economic Security (pronounced "Dee-Swiz"). 

As is tradition, you're posted to hell-hole planets where if the fauna doesn't get you the people will - all the while cleaning-up messes, alleviating self-inflicted suffering, and finding the socially-optimum amount of inequallity for every government intervention.

# Problem Topics:
Many of these problems will run the gammet of disciplines:
- Process Science & Operations Research
- Behavioral Economics
- Chemical Engineering
- Environmental Sciences
