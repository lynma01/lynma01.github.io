# A Sneaking Suspicion
I've mostly completed my first ever python CLI-app for automatically extracting data in a particularly torturous .tsv format from a Microsoft SQL Server database. The experience has gotten me thinking about how I think about programming. 

> I'm under the constant suspicion that I've been doing things extremely inefficiently, but because I don't know any better way- I'm left with only an unproven feeling.  

This is where many tutorials or help-articles fall flat: they can only help you solve the problem at hand, but weaving those solutions together into a meaningful whole? Yeah, Stackoverflow can only get you so far. The problem of *crafting* an efficient whole from a series of disparate parts is no easy-thing. And it's gotten me extremely intruiged about what I believe the important problem to be: getting better at the *craft*, and I stand by my usage of the word[^what_is_craft].

Now, I certainly have no-one to answer to with this script. It's about ~700 lines of python code acting as a wrapper for ~2,000 lines of SQL. I can't complain too hard, given that I didn't have to write the SQL  

I feel as though there's a specific kind of mental-block that occurs in people who learned programming through Excel as I have. And that's largely evinced through my complete confusion whenever I see a `class` declaration. 



[^what_is_craft]: Programming is inherently practical, and while this is unintuitive[^what_is_unintuitive] for the many people who don't write code for a living, [the bare-minimum is to have the program compile](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/6341736-any-fool-can-write-code-that-a-computer-can-understand). However, for those of us who do write code, hell, even those of who deal with really complicated spreadsheets or PowerBI reports for a living, there exists an "elegance" within any solution; or a solution created with/in "[good taste](https://github.com/mkirchner/linked-list-good-taste)". I call "solutions-with-elegance" a *craft*.   

[^managers_standards]: In the US at least, everyone's first instinct on LinkedIn is to refer to them selves as an *engineer* of some-sort to negotiate a higher salary. But while people with technical skills may abound (cough, cough), there seems to be an enormous deficit when it comes to managers who insist on code-quality standards which improve the overall experience for their employees.

[^what_is_unintuitive]: My general litmus test for "intuitive-ness" comes from conversations with my 76 year-old grandfather. I would include my grandmother in that criteria, however, she prefers vastly different conversational topics and I do my best to respect her wishes in all cases.
