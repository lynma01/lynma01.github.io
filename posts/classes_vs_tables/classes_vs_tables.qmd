# A Sneaking Suspicion
I've mostly completed my first ever python CLI-app for automatically extracting data in a particularly torturous .tsv format from a Microsoft SQL Server database. The experience has gotten me thinking about how I think about programming. 

> I'm under the constant suspicion that I've been doing things extremely inefficiently, but because I don't know any better way- I'm left with only an unproven feeling.  

This is where many tutorials or help-articles fall flat: they can only help you solve the problem at hand, but they can't help you solve the most important problem- getting better at the *craft*, and I stand by my usage of the word[^1].

I feel as though there's a specific kind of mental-block that occurs in people who learned programming through Excel as I have. And that's largely evinced through my complete confusion whenever I see `class` . 

[^1]: In the US at least, everyone's first instinct on LinkedIn is to refer to them selves as an *engineer* of some-sort to negotiate a higher salary. But without some sense of "taste"
