# A Sneaking Suspicion
I've mostly completed my first ever python CLI-app for automatically extracting data in a particularly torturous .tsv format from a Microsoft SQL Server database. The experience has gotten me thinking about how I think about programming. 

> I'm under the constant suspicion that I've been doing things extremely inefficiently, but because I don't know any better way- I'm left with only an unproven feeling.  

This is where many tutorials or help-articles fall flat: they can only help you solve the problem at hand, but they can't help you solve the most important problem- getting better at the *craft*, and I stand by my usage of the word[^what_is_craft].

I feel as though there's a specific kind of mental-block that occurs in people who learned programming through Excel as I have. And that's largely evinced through my complete confusion whenever I see `class` . 

[^what_is_craft]: Programming is inherently practical, but just like many other "engineering" professions, the people who undertake the work are quick to differentiate themselves based on the quality of their output. [The bare-minimum is to have the program compile](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/6341736-any-fool-can-write-code-that-a-computer-can-understand), but on the other end of the spectrum is "elegant" programming; or programming with/in "[good taste](https://github.com/mkirchner/linked-list-good-taste)".  

[^managers_standards]: In the US at least, everyone's first instinct on LinkedIn is to refer to them selves as an *engineer* of some-sort to negotiate a higher salary. But while people with technical skills may abound (cough, cough), there seems to be an enormous deficit when it comes to managers who insist on code-quality standards which improve the overall experience for their employees.
