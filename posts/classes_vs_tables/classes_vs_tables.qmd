# Summary
I've mostly completed my first ever python CLI-app for automatically extracting data in a particularly torturous .tsv format from a Microsoft SQL Server database. The experience has gotten me thinking about how I think about programming. Likewise, after reading help-article after help-article, it's gotten me comparing my own mental-models against how other developers on the internet think.

My only conclusion is that there's a specific kind of mental-block that occurs in people who learned programming through Excel as I have. Arguably,  ***classes***.
